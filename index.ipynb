The vector is the length of the entire vocabulary -- usually, every word that occurs in the English language, or at least every word that appears in our corpus.  Any given sentence can then be represented as a vector where all the vector is 1 (or some other value) for each time that word appears in the sentence. \n",

This is a more advanced form of vectorization that weighs each term in a document by how unique it is to the given document it is contained in, which allows us to summarize the contents of a document using a few key words.  If the word is used often in many other documents, it is not unique, and therefore probably not too useful if we wanted to figure out how this document is unique in relation to other documents. Conversely, if a word is used many times in a document, but rarely in all the other documents we are considering, then it is likely a good indicator for telling us that this word is important to the document in question.  \n",
